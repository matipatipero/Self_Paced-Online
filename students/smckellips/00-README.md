This dir serves as my classwork directory.

It is named with a "00" at the beginning, so it will show up at the top of file listings.

Each student will create their own similar directory, and then use it to manage their classwork,
and submit it to the instructors for review.

For each Exercise, please create a new dir for that exercise, and then put your python files, etc in that dir, add them to your git repo, and push to your fork on gitHub.
